Introduction : 

Cloud Computing Introduction 
Benefits of Cloud Computing 
Key Cloud Terminology

    - Fault Tolerance 
    - High Availability 
    - Scalability 
    - Elasticity 

What is a cloud?

    Using computing resources somewhere else which is owned by somebody else for a payment 
    You are basically using a server in a datacenter somewhere 

    - Its a linux / Windows based server 
    - Its someone else computer which we rent 

Fault tolerance : 

    Redundency or Resiliancy 
    If a malfunction happens its not lost since it lives on a remote data center  
    If the data is just present in cloud server so its never lost. 

High Availability : 

    Its not just present in cloud, its also highly avaialble in cloud 
    You could access these files using the internet and download in any other devices where you want these files 
    With internet connection the data is never lost. 

Scalabilty :  

    Forcasting user demand is super difficult 
    this leads to wasted money on resources 
    With these challenges on mind, cloud service providers actually help scaling up and down and charge only to 
    servers which the customers have used. 
    Within minutes we could scale up and down 
    
Azure Organization and Infrastructure : 

    - Azure Global Infra 
    - Azure Services 
    - Resource Hierarchy and Organization 
    - Indentity and Access Management 
    - Monitoring your Azure Environment 

Organization and Relationships 

    - Physical and Digital organization 
    - Nested Relationships 
    - Solutions and Visibility 

What is Azure? :  

    - Its a Microsoft Public cloud computing platform ( Anyone could use it)
    - It has over 200 indiviuslaproducts and services 
    - Build,run and manage applications on Microsofts global infrastucture 
        - IAAS
        - SAAS 
        - PAAS 
    Supplement or replace existing on-premises computing services 
    The main advantage is pay-as-you-go pricing in which you only pay for what you use 

        - No up-front commitment for resources
        - Billed by the second for using services  -  eg :  use a VM for 103 seconds, only pay for 103 seonds 
        - Cloud Terminology : Operational expense - Expense on operation 

Azure's Global Infrastructure :  

    Region  :  Group of Datacenteres in a single geographical Location 
    Availability zone :  One of Several unique Locations in a Region
