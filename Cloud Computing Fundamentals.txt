Introduction : 

Cloud Computing Introduction 
Benefits of Cloud Computing 
Key Cloud Terminology

    - Fault Tolerance 
    - High Availability 
    - Scalability 
    - Elasticity 

What is a cloud?

    Using computing resources somewhere else which is owned by somebody else for a payment 
    You are basically using a server in a datacenter somewhere 

    - Its a linux / Windows based server 
    - Its someone else computer which we rent 

Fault tolerance : 

    Redundency or Resiliancy 
    If a malfunction happens its not lost since it lives on a remote data center  
    If the data is just present in cloud server so its never lost. 

High Availability : 

    Its not just present in cloud, its also highly avaialble in cloud 
    You could access these files using the internet and download in any other devices where you want these files 
    With internet connection the data is never lost. 

Scalabilty :  

    Forcasting user demand is super difficult 
    this leads to wasted money on resources 
    With these challenges on mind, cloud service providers actually help scaling up and down and charge only to 
    servers which the customers have used. 
    Within minutes we could scale up and down 
    
Azure Organization and Infrastructure : 

    - Azure Global Infra 
    - Azure Services 
    - Resource Hierarchy and Organization 
    - Indentity and Access Management 
    - Monitoring your Azure Environment 

Organization and Relationships 

    - Physical and Digital organization 
    - Nested Relationships 
    - Solutions and Visibility 

What is Azure? :  

    - Its a Microsoft Public cloud computing platform ( Anyone could use it)
    - It has over 200 indiviuslaproducts and services 
    - Build,run and manage applications on Microsofts global infrastucture 
        - IAAS
        - SAAS 
        - PAAS 
    Supplement or replace existing on-premises computing services 
    The main advantage is pay-as-you-go pricing in which you only pay for what you use 

        - No up-front commitment for resources
        - Billed by the second for using services  -  eg :  use a VM for 103 seconds, only pay for 103 seonds 
        - Cloud Terminology : Operational expense - Expense on operation 

Azure's Global Infrastructure :  

    Region  :  Group of Datacenteres in a single geographical Location 

            High Availability Fault Tolerance 
            Be closer to your end users and defend against regional outage 

    Availability zone :  One of Several unique Locations in a Region 

            Availability zone is an individual and self contained data center. So within a region you keep 3 or 4 availability zones 
            for better reach of data. They are connected seriously with each other so if one fails, the other one comes into picture 

Azure Services: 

Over 200 services available or any solutions required 

    - Large number of managed services for multiple use caes 
    - Different types of IAAS, PAAS and SAAS offerings 

    Traditional IT 

        - You manage all 
    
    Infrastructure ; 
    
        - You manage most 

                - Virtual Servers 
                - You are responsible for maintaining OS 

    Platform: 
        
        - You manage some 

                - Cloud vendor maintains infrastructure for you 
                - You focus on the application code and data 

    Software : 

        - You manage very less 

                - Vendor provides the full software stack 


Azure Resource Manager :  

    All interactions goes throuh Azure Resource Manager / ARM 

    Centralized Managed Layer 

        - Web Portal 
        - Command Line Interface 
        - Application access 
        - Access Control (Authentication)
    
Azure Resource and Hierarchy and Organization 

    - How do we organize our Azure Resources and Services 
    - How do we track who is paying for what 
    - How do we limit who has accss to different sets of resources? 

Azure Resource Hierarchy :  

    All Resources start with Azure Tenant 

        Management Groups ---> Subscriptions  ---> Resource Groups  ---> Resources 

Azure Resource Hierarchy Fundamentals 

    All resourcs are assigned to a Parent Child Relationships 
    Access / policies granted to parent inherited by child levels 
    Centralized Management 
    Parent have multiple children but a child can have only single parent 
    Similar to operating system file structure 


    Tenent  -  Single Orgaization instance of Azure Active Directory |  Single bucket to manage all users 
    Management groups  - Grouping components | Central management of multiple susbscriptions 
    Subscriptions -  Primary billing and access isolation boundary | Each subscription has its own billing agreement 
    Resource Groups -  Group resources togather for same purpose or lifecycle | All Azure resources are created in Resource Groups 
    Resources -  Anything Created on Azure (VM, Storage account etc)


    Tenant - Organization / Azure ID users 
    Subscriptions  Centralized Management of Subscriptions 


Azure Identity and Aces Management : 

    Take it in three levels 
        - Who 
        - Can do what 
        - on which resources
